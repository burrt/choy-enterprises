# My first post!

*Basically I finally got around to redoing my Github Pages website with Jekyll!*

## Why

So I first heard about Jekyll many years ago with its excellent support with Markdown notes - I just never bothered to take a look at it seriously.
It's one of those backlog items that you never really get around to :)

Anyways, I finally decided to categorize my existing Computer Science Markdown notes that I've accumulated whilst studying and they're hosted on [Github pages here](https://burrt.github.io/compsci-docs/).
This was the beginnings of my Jekyll journey and as we all say - It's much harder to start than to continue.

My old website was simply using an existing Bootstrap static website template and I basically dumped everything in the HTML.
It was not a fun experience whenever I needed to add or modify stuff - fortunately it was infrequent.
But as time goes by, the more something bugs you, you'll eventually address it so I did!
