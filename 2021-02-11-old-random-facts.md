* [Cards](#cards)
* [Semicolons](#semicolons)

## Maximum PPI

* Depends on many things eg. 20/20 vision - 477 ppi at 30cm
* The maximum acuity of a healthy human eye is 20/16 to 20/12
* The average visual acuity of the human eye is one arc minute. The maximum possible is 0.4 arc minutes.
* If the average reading distance is 1 foot (305 mm), p @0.4 arc minute is 720 ppi/dpi. p @1 arc minute is 300 dpi/ppi.

## Gross domestic product (GDP)

* GDP is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly). GDP estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons.
* GDP is not a complete measure of economic activity. It accounts for final output or value added at each stage of production, but not total output or total sales along the entire production process.

## The Four Jihads

* Jihad of the hand: good deeds, especially charity
* Jihad of the mouth: proclaiming the faith
* Jihad of the heard: self transformation towards being God-centred
* Jihad of the sword: defending Islam as a mujahid, warrior of God

## Water resistance

* **IPX6** – Protects from powerful water jets. So if you modified your super soaker with an air compressor and * an aftermarket tip, your stuff is still safe.
* **IPX7** – This is for full water splashdown. If you drop your device in water up to 1 metre your device is still going to work.

## Sample rate

* Measured in KHz, how many samples per second eg. 44.1KHz
* affected by Bit Depth i.e. 24bits amount of levels possible in a wave

## Bit rate

> e.g. you have 30 seconds audio file sampled at a rate of 44.1 KHz and quantized using 8 bits ; calculate the bit rate and the size of mono and stereo versions of this file ?

`Bitrate = Bits Per Sample * Samples Per Second * Channels`

So in this case for stereo the bitrate is `8 * 44100 * 2 = 705 600kbps`
To get the file size multiply by the bitrate by the duration (in seconds), and divide by 8 (to get from bits to bytes):
`fileSize = (bitsPerSample * samplesPerSecond * channels * duration) / 8`

So in this case 30 seconds of stereo will take up `(8 * 44100 * 2 * 30) / 8 = 2 646 000 bytes`

## Camera specs explained

### Light sensor

Larger the sensor the better. If the sensor is too small, it will be limited by how much light it can accept - 'crop' issue if you have a lens with a large aperture? Larger sensors capture more light and produce better images.
Usually small sensors eg. phone, use image post processing to compensate the size limitation, can produce varied results.

### Aperture

Maximum aperture (f/3.5), or how wide the lens can open. A wider aperture means
it can let in more light. More light means you can take photos more easily where there isn't a lot of lighting.
Wide apertures are generally considered to be in the range of f/1.4 - f/2.8.

## Cards

1. Royal Flush: the best possible straight flush Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace all of the same suit.
2. Straight Flush: Cards of five consecutive ranks, all of the same suit
3. 4 of a Kind: four cards of any one rank, and any other card
4. Ful House: Three cards of one rank, and two cards of a second rank.
5. Flush Five: cards of the same suit that doesn't make a straight
6. Straight: Cards of five consecutive ranks when not all five are of the same suit
7. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank and two unrelated cards
8. Two Pair: Two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and a fifth
9. One Pair: Two cards of the same rank and three other unrelated cards
10. High Card: Known as a 'Busted Hand'. Five unrelated cards – no pair, no flush, no straight. Nothing.

## Semicolons

* A semicolon is most commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought. When a semicolon is used to join two or more ideas (parts) in a sentence, those ideas are then given equal position or rank.
  * *Some people write with a word processor; others write with a pen or pencil.*
* Use a semicolon between two independent clauses that are connected by conjunctive adverbs or transitional phrases.
  * *But however they choose to write, people are allowed to make their own decisions; as a result, many people swear by their writing methods.*
* Use a semicolon between items in a list or series if any of the items contain commas.
  * *There are basically two ways to write: with a pen or pencil, which is inexpensive and easily accessible; or by computer and printer, which is more expensive but quick and neat.*
* Use a semicolon between independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction if the clauses are already punctuated with commas or if the clauses are lengthy.
  * *Some people write with a word processor, typewriter, or a computer; but others, for different reasons, choose to write with a pen or pencil.*
