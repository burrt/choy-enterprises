# Rich Dad Poor Dad

So I've finally ventured into reading some finance when someone recommended me "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. It was perhaps one of the best reads I've had in a long time, in the sense that I stayed up to finish it and even read it as an eBook! Both behaviors I haven't done in many years haha.

On a more serious note, upon completing the book, it kept me awake rolling in my bed as I pondered many of its (well, for me anyway) revolutionizing insights into the world of money. What is deceiving in the book is that its core message isn't about getting rich - instead, it emphasizes **intelligence** - specifically, financial intelligence. You can draw many parallels to other fields where the growth mindset, pragmatism and critical thinking are common talking points, albeit more implicit.

In many ways, the "Poor Dad" in the story is very much myself and my own dad - and after completing the book, I'm very inspired to change this. There were so many epiphany moments whilst reading that I was often ashamed in my own ignorance - being financially illiterate. On the flip-side, the ecstasy of learning something so new and different, was and _is_ one of the greatest joys in life. This book I believe will be a catalyst for my future financial pursuits and perhaps one of those life changing moments - as Kiyosaki referenced Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken".

Although I feel I will revisit his book often, I do want to etch his key lessons in my blog.

### The Rich Don't Work for Money

> The poor and middle class work **for money**. The rich have money work **for them**.

This was my favorite part of the book when Kiyosaki retells his childhood memories of wanting to be rich in order to "hangout with the cool kids". The lessons the "rich" father instilled into him and his friend was a turning point for both of them. In their naivety and creativity, they thought themselves geniuses when they melted used toothpaste bottles (copper back then) gathered from the neighborhood into money. They were so close to the secret to getting rich - in the sense to not _work for money_.

> Fear and greed - controlling emotions

It never stops surprises me when the financial world talks about emotions - I have always found the industry very similar to the tech industry where it's a rather "un-emotional" environment. The difference between the two is that the financial sector benefits (or should I say, _exploits_) from the emotional element in most peoples' dealings with money. Some of the tech industry in a sense, do as well, for example social media. But the process of creating software is often a very logical, rational and un-emotional process. And the end product is increasingly trying to leverage our emotions - notice there are "reaction" emojis now - and the improvements in AI is only accelerating this process.

So going back to the book, the rich dad explains how most people simply work because of their **fear** of losing what they have i.e. lifestyle, house etc. This leads to the continuous cycle of waking up everyday under the fear factor, working hard to "work for money" so that they can pay their bills but the **greed** always grows. Most people think that when they get rich or obtain a pay-rise/promotion, then all their problems will be solved. But this is seldom the case, rather it becomes the new "normal" and the fear of losing their living standards upgrade forces them through the grind once more without ever becoming richer - this is the **trap** the rich dad tells the kids.

> So many people say, "Oh I'm not interested in money." Yet they work at a job for eight hours a day.

This is fear dominating when people just think of "paying the bills". Instead of being afraid of money, learn to master (control) it by understanding what money is and how it works. Ignorance leads to fear and greed.

> To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really living a life. That's cruel, and that's the trap I want you to avoid. A job is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Don't let money control you.

When the kids overcame the pay-rise offered by the rich dad at the shop, they _overcame their greed_. And when they agreed to work for _free_, they _overcame the fear_ of money.

> Keep using your **brain**, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you.

So much of the book is centered around using your brain - your greatest asset - constantly in all situations and in order to really push it, allow yourself to be pressured. Working for free is one way, and another method is to reward yourself first before paying your bills. Imagination and creativity is key to success and wealth.

### Why Teach Financial Literacy

> It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep.

Today's world is increasingly becoming faster, particularly with the dominance of technology, thus it's imperative that we invest in our greatest wealth - education. Be prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind an learn - then you grow richer despite tough changes. If you think money will solve problems, then you will have a tough time. **Intelligence** solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone.

The rich dad couldn't stress the importance of financial literacy to the to kids enough but neither did he tell them to neglect their education which is modelled on the principle to "work for money". Knowledge was still crucial but to understand how to use it financially is an altogether different problem that isn't taught at schools.

> Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they **think** are assets.

* **Asset**: puts money in your pocket
  * Rental income
  * Dividends
  * Interest
  * Royalties
* **Liability**: takes money out of your pocket
  * Taxes
  * Mortgage payments
  * Car loans
  * CC debt

> Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.

So this part is better explained with images and I think the book really does justice here.

#### Cash flow of an asset

Assets put money into your pocket. Rich people buy assets and continue to invest in assets.

![Asset](https://i.imgur.com/tTWqm0vl.png)

#### Cash flow of a liability

The key take-way is that liabilities take money out of your pocket and flow into the expenses category. Middle class people spend their lives buying liabilities (they think they're assets).

![Liability](https://i.imgur.com/iVXjL6al.png)

#### Cash flow of a poor person

#### Cash flow of a middle class person

#### The Rat Race

> A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate.

The fallacy we are trapped in is that we are educated to get a job, earn money and make more money - the belief that money will solve your problems. Because financial aptitude is missing from our education, working harder will only exacerbate our problems instead of solving them.

The classic story of hardworking people who get married, move into their rented apartment together, realize that they save money since it's one room now. But after some time, it's a bit cramped so they save money to buy a house. Career focus, and long hours are put in to achieve the dream house - as their incomes increase, so do their **expenses**.

The **biggest expense is taxes** - as you earn more, you pay more in tax. So once the couple buy their dream house, they buy a new car, furniture, appliances etc. Suddenly the liabilities section is over-populated. With mortgage and credit card debt growing - they are now in the **Rat Race** - the race to the bottom.

Once a baby comes along, they work harder and so incomes increase, so does the taxes. _And the cycle continues..._ Typically their only source of income is their paycheck and therefore are entirely dependent on their employer. So when "opportunities of a decade" comes along, they can't take advantage of them - they are so busy working hard, taxed to the max and are loaded with debt.

Most people allow **money to control them**, by simply getting up to leave for work every morning to work harder is simply shooting themselves in the foot. Because they do not understand money or how to manage it, they cannot control money. Instead they follow the crowd, they do what every one says: "diversify", "your home is an asset", "your home is your biggest investment", "get a safe job", "don't take risks"... The fear of standing out from the crowd and FOMO is even stronger with the rise of social media and technology.

> An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is

Networking and learning from smarter individuals is extremely valuable - learn a little of everything.

> The most important rule is to know the difference between an asset and liability

Once that has been achieved, concentrate your efforts in buying income-generating assets. The asset column will grow and will become so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments: investments that may have returns of 100% to infinite. Investments that the middle class term "too risky" - **investment is not risky for the financially literate**.

Focus on building your asset cash-flows to cover your expenses - this will mean you will no longer be dependent on your employer (company, government, bank).

### Mind your own business

> The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements

Understand your business and assets e.g. McDonald's real estate is what makes it so valuable and Ray was someone who knew the the significance of all his locations. Most people spend their entire lives minding someone elses business and **not their own** - the reward for this is often debt. Your business revolves around the asset column and this is what the rich focuses on - working for an employer is still necessary but remember it should always be a short-term goal.

> Businesses that **I own** do not require my presence, instead they are managed or run by **other people**. If I have to work there, it's not a business - it becomes my job.

Remember the success of starting your own company is very slim - decide carefully before committing.

> Once a dollar goes into your assets, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

### The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations

In 1913, income tax became permanent in the US and it took around 50 years to sell the idea of a regular income tax. This all came to fruition by selling the story to the poor and middle class that the rich should be punished with taxes. Thus the masses voted for it and although it initially "punished" the rich minority, it eventually made everyone suffer.

> Once the government got a taste of money, its appetite grew.

Government gets paid to hire and spend money, and the larger the organization becomes, the more respected it is and the more money it needs and therefore higher taxes.

For the private sector, success determines the pay and the fewer people are hired, the less money is spent, the more respect is earned from its investors.

These are competing sectors and it's important to know that and it's why the private sector fights really hard against the government so their money isn't simply sucked away. The reason "take from the rich" failed is because the poor and middle class lacked financial literacy and the rich always found a way to outsmart them - thus the eventual taxing on the poor and middle class.

> If you work for money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.

Not allowing the world to push you around - be financially smart, acquire power over money and control it. If you know you are right about something, it is far easier to stand up.

#### Financial IQ

It is the synergy of many skills and talents.

1. Accounting - financial literacy (left-brain)
2. Investing - strategies and formulas (right-brain)
3. Understanding markets - science of supply and demand, emotion-driven markets
4. The law
5. Tax advantages
6. Protection from lawsuits - everyone wants a piece, learn to protect your wealth

### The Rich Invent Money

> Often in the real word, it's not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.

Financial genius requires both technical knowledge as well as courage - everyone has that brave, brilliant and daring character within them. To let fear an self-doubt suppress your personal genius, you will miss out. Boldness will be required to take "risks" and to adapt to change - instead of _dreading change_. Remember to learn to let go of old ideas and be open for new ideas - this is the modern age where information is more accessible than ever.

> Games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems. See CASHFLOW classic.

Playing "financial" games pushes the loser to question, "Now what can you do?", "How many different financial options can you come up with?"

This can also be applied to the real-world. Teaching yourself to think and create new and various financial options, to get out of the Rat Race. Those that do are the ones who understand numbers and have creative financial minds. Rich people are often creative and take calculated risks.

In Monopoly, you see the same kinds of people playing the game: those that say if they had more money, then xyz. Others that read out aloud their opportunity without knowing it is one - most people don't realize their opportunities of a life time and when they do, it's too late.

Financial intelligence is simply having more options. If the opportunities aren't coming your way, what else can you do to improve your financial position? If an opportunity lands in your lap and the bank won't talk to you, what do you do? What else can you do to get the opportunity to work in your favor? If you're hunch is wong, and what you've been counting on doesn't happen, how can you turn a lemon into millions? _This is financial intelligence_ - it is how many different financial solutions you can think of to turn a lemon into millions. It is how creative you are in solving financial problems.

Most know only one: work hard, save, and borrow. Instead be someone who creates their own luck.

> The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.

If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth, on the other-hand, an untrained mind can also create extreme poverty that can crush a family for generations.

> Which sounds harder to you?
>
> 1. Work Hard. Pay 50% in taxes and save what is left. Your savings earn 5%, which is also taxed.
> 2. Take the time to develop your financial intelligence and harness the power of your brain and the asset column.

If option 1. is your choice, remember how long it will take - **time** is one of your greatest assets and is constant for everyone.

Investments come and go, market goes up and down as do opportunities and so on. These happen every day and you only need to be aware of them. Being financially intelligent will convert those opportunities to success, and will give you the ability to adapt in the ever changing world with technology accelerating its pace. The more intelligence you have, the easier it is to tell if a deal is good or bad.

Investors also know how to put pieces together - knowing the bigger picture and how to fit them together can take years but this is where the big wins are.

1. Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.
   * See with your mind, not your eyes.
2. Raise money
   * Don't just think of borrowing money from the bank.
3. Organize smart people
   * Intelligent people are those who work with or hire a person who is more intelligent than they are. When you need advice, make sure you choose your advisor wisely.

There is always risk, so learn to manage risk instead of avoiding it.

### Work to Learn - Don't work for money

> The world is filled with smart, talented, educated, and gifted people. We meet them every day and they are all around us. "They are one skill away from great wealth."

Mastering one more skill and their incomes would jump exponentially. Combining skills and knowledge is just like investing - putting the pieces together and the gains are large. When it comes to money however, the only skill most people know is to work hard.

Even if learning "how to sell" or moving to a different department at the cost of a salary cut, to gain skills in public relations and communication, these choices can pay huge dividends to one's career. Remember the reporter and interview in Singapore of "best-selling author" and "best-writing author".

> "You want to know a little about a lot" was rich dad's suggestion.

One of the hardest part of running a company is managing people. Rich dad valued learning to lead men into dangerous situations. "Leadership is what you need to learn next," rich dad said. "If you're not a good leader, you'll get shot in the back, just like they do in business."

> Once people are trapped in the lifelong process of bill-paying, they become like those little hamsters running around in those metal wheels. Their little legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is turning furiously, but come tomorrow morning, they'll still be in the same cage. Great job.

Take a long view of your life, instead of simply working for the money and security (which is still important), consider a second job that will teach a second skill - for example, a network-marketing company, also called multilevel marketing, if you want to learn sales skills. Learning to overcome fear and rejection are crucial to be successful. The ability to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, etc. is the base skill of personal success. Communication skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating are crucial to a life of success. Be sure to invest in them. _Education is more valuable that money_.

> You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

Unless a person is used to changing, it's hard to change. It's like going to the gym, once you're there it's easy and after it's over, it was all worth it.

The main management skills needed for success are:

1. Management of cash flow
2. Management of systems
3. Management of people

### Overcoming obstacles

There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow:

1. [Fear](2020-04-07-rich-dad-poor-dad.md#fear)
2. [Cynicism](2020-04-07-rich-dad-poor-dad.md#cynicism)
3. [Laziness](2020-04-07-rich-dad-poor-dad.md#laziness)
4. [Bad habits](2020-04-07-rich-dad-poor-dad.md#bad-habits)
5. [Arrogance](2020-04-07-rich-dad-poor-dad.md#arrogance)

#### Fear

Overcome the fear and risk of losing money - actively think about it. Do not say "I don't want to think/talk about it (money)." Learn to turn failures into positives, this is often achieved by getting back up from failures and many too.

If you have dreams of freedom - of getting out of the Rat Race - ask yourself, "How do I respond to failure?" If failure inspires you, then be prepared to have the guts, patience, and a great attitude towards failure. Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners.

#### Cynicism

There's a Chicken Little that's all inside of us - the fear and doubt that clouds our thoughts - "I'm not smart enough." "I'm not good enough." "So-and-so is better than me." "What if the economy crashes right after I invest?"

Doubts paralyze us and causes **inaction** - we fail to move forward. Sometimes it is that one thing we need to overcome and then it will all flow on from then. Cynics never win and they blind us, winners open their eyes and analyze.

> So when you're in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Colonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.

#### Laziness

> Busy people are often the most lazy.
>
> He works hard to be a good provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the office and brings work home on weekends. > Then one day he comes home to an empty house - his wife has left with the kids. He knew there was a relationship problem but rather than work to make it strong, he stayed _busy at work_. Dismayed, his performance drops at work and he loses his job.

Likewise there are many who are too busy to take care of their wealth - the cause is the same. They're busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down they know. In fact, if you remind them, they get annoyed, angry, frustrated.

> What's the most common form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.

So what's the cure? A little **greed**. We have always been told to greed is bad but it can be used as a motivation to overcome laziness.

> Rich dad believed that the words "I can't afford it" shutdown your brain. "How can I afford it?" opens up possibilities, excitement and dreams.

Now you're forced to open up your brain and find answers. "I can't afford it" causes sadness and helplessness that leads to despondency and often depression. Thus you need to get out of the trap.

> It is not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal that is important to learn.

#### Bad habits

> Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education.

An example of a good habit of rich people is that they are willing to _reward themselves first_ before paying their bills. This isn't to say **not** to pay your bills on time but in the situation when you invest in your assets first but then don't have enough to pay your bills - this is an opportunity.

The pressure makes you work hard, forces you to think and all in all, makes you smarter and more active with money. If there's no pressure, you stagnate. Remember that life - bosses, managers, tax collectors etc. - will push you around if you let it.

#### Arrogance

> "What I know makes me money. What I don't know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I'm arrogant, I truly believe that what I don't know is **not** important."

Many people use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance. They're not lying but they are not telling the truth. Don't be arrogant but instead educate yourself on the matter if you don't know or understand it.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit

If you do not have a strong reason, there's no sense reading further. It will sound like too much work.

I don't want to work all my life, I want the freedom to change industries, run my own company and to get out of the Rat Race.

#### 2. Make daily choice: the power of choice

Most people choose not to be rich because it's too much hassle - "I'm not interested in money." "I'll never be rich." "I'm still young." These statements **rob you of two things**: time and learning.

The daily choice we make: the choice of what we do with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. This is the power of choice.

Remember to keep an open mind, you can always disagree with someone but make sure to understand why someone said so. What you know today may change and always be willing to change. Having more options and perspectives will always be beneficial for every problem you encounter.

A truly intelligent person welcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other accumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking.

#### 3. Choose friends carefully: the power of association

This isn't to say not to make friends with poor or less intelligent people - but it is to be aware of the power of making friends with more intelligent and rich people.

If you just end up arguing with people about money, then it's a waste of time for both. On the other hand, if you discuss money with those interested in money, it suddenly becomes a learning exercise for both parties.

Remember to listen to both sides of the coin - keep your mind open but never let fear and ignorance betray you.

#### 4. Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly

> It's not about how much you know anymore because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn.

Learn something and then put it into practice and master it. Then look for other formulas, combine them, improve them and make them faster.

#### 5. Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline

Lack of self-discipline is what makes lottery winners poor soon-after. People who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for financial pressure can never be rich. Don't let the world push you around, you must learn to fight back. People who lack internal fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.

The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are:

1. Cash flow
2. People
3. Personal time

![pay-yourself-first](https://i.imgur.com/alPtN8Ml.png)

![pay-everyone-first](https://i.imgur.com/WkRtE3Vl.png)

You will need to have the guts to go against the tide, against the little chicken in your head. When you reward yourself first and are under those pressure situations, learn to control your fear and use your brain to overcome the situation.

**Don't dip into savings** - this is a common bad habit. The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills.

#### 6. Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice

Information is priceless and you should likewise pay professionals well - their services should make you money and the more money they make, the more money you make. People who are reliable and intelligent will save you time (one of your most valuable assets) and make you money.

Many middle mangers remain middle managers because they know how to work with people below them but **not** with people above them. The real skill is to manage and reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical areas. It's why companies have a board of directors - you should have one too.

#### 7. Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing

> How fast do I get my money back?

Be sure to know your return on investment (ROI). For every investment, look for something you get for free e.g. a pice of free land, shares etc. McDonald's fame was in the hamburger franchise but he wanted the real estate beneath it for free.

#### 8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus

Like the "greed", use it to inspire and motivate your financial genius. Even if you don't win at the start, learn from it and invest even more in your financial intelligence. Bad habits of taking the quick and easy route - the easy road always becomes hard and the hard road often becomes easy.

#### 9. Choose your heroes: the power of myth

Heroes make things look easy. When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard - change your mindset, and it will change your behavior.

#### 10. Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving

> If you want something, first you need to give

The principle of reciprocity is true - respect it and abide by it.

> Whenever I feel that people aren't smiling at me, I simply begin smiling and saying hello. Like magic, the next thing I know I'm surrounded by smiling people. It is true that your world is only a mirror of you.

### Still want more? Here are some Todo's

* Stop doing what you're doing
  * Take a break and assess what is working and what is not working
* Look for new ideas
  * Whether that is a new book or training course
* Take classes, read and attend seminars
* Make lots of offers
  * You never know who's buying so make an offer and do as little work as possible e.g. make the real estate agent work, that's his job to find out what the price is
* Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes
  * There might be bargains in your area, talk to people, drivers, etc.
  * This is like insider knowledge that is easy to incorporate in your life
* Look for people who want to buy first. Then look for someone who wants to sell.
  * This can lead to taking a slice of the pie
* Action always beats inaction

### Final Thoughts

> Money is only an idea. If you want more money, simply change your thinking.

There are three different types of incomes and in order how heavily taxed:

1. Ordinary earned
2. Portfolio - derived from stocks, bones etc.
3. Passive - mostly real estate

Know the differences and learn to acquire as much passive income as possible and to retain your wealth. Ordinary earned income is money you work for, and passive and portfolio income is money working for you.
