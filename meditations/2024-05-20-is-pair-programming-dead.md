# Is Pair Programming Dead?

I must reiterate that these are just transient thoughts that are often not thought through in great depth!

So with GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT 4 and a myriad of other AI tools that assist developers in coding - what happened to the irl pair programmer? In Extreme Programming, having literally **two** programmers on one computer was a discipline strongly advocated for and supposedly had many advantages; for companies that could "afford" to adopt such approach anyways.

But now we have the ability for one of the pair to be a "bot", and arguably a better coder than the majority as well. So where does that leave pair programming? The code generation ability of say ChatGPT is already challenging the role of programmers, perhaps it has just buried the old concept of pair programming too?
