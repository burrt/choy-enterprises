# Why is the pyramid scheme upside down?

In the context of a capitalist world, why is it that we reward the least to those who bring us the greatest enjoyment, knowledge and help? Take for example the hospitality industry; food is not only essential to our sustenance, but it is often one of our greatest daily enjoyments and yet, those who work in it are the lowest paid, hardest worked and suffer from the most ills of life.

Do people not realise that chefs often work long night shifts, weekends, and have to contend with the stressful working environment. And they are paid so little - this is how we reward their dedication to their passion of providing us enjoyment when we dine in. In the process, they pay a price for this lifestyle, often involving alcoholism, drugs, smoking, depression etc. And this world does little to recognise this, much less support them.

Another is health care and support workers; how is it that those who provide us with health essential services and care have one of the lowest average salaries? They too have long, late shifts, and yet they are there when we are in times of greatest need.

But look around you, everyone is head down, with eye-avoiding gazes on their morning commute to the "CBD", all to make money for the wrong people. It's upside down. So few see it, fewer question it, even fewer challenge it - how to reverse such tragedy?

Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that there is a particular population size where a society's value of community bonds and fellowship cannot be sustained and they inevitably degrade. Now, particular cultures and sizes of states have an influence to this, but largely, I think the thesis holds when factoring in locality. Yet, within this, small societal microcosms can, I believe, have a real community with great care in its cultivation - it's something I want to be part of building and sustaining. To chip away at this change, a goal worth pursuing.
