### Journalists

This is a quote from "Fooled By Randomness - Nassim Taleb":

> There are hordes of thoughtful journalists in the business (I would suggest London's Anatole Kaletsky and New York's Jim Grant and Alan Abelson as the underrated representatives of such a class among financial journalists; Gary Stix among scientific journalists);

I'll look into where exactly they publish but I thought I'd put this down otherwise it will always be buried in my things to do...
