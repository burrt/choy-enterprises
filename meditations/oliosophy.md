# Oliosophy

Oliosophy is a philosophy my squash coach (Ollie) imparted on me over the years; from when I first started learning squash to the realisation his lessons were more than just squash. I never thought I would encounter philosophy on the squash courts, particularly when I was new to the sport but it made all the difference. So you might be wondering, what is "Oliosophy"? Is it just another trending "how to live your life in the 202X world"? No, it is more akin to Marcus Aurelius' _Meditations_, fragmented learnings, lessons and reflections of life...

### The River of Life

> You only need to think about the ball you're going to hit right now, not the one that just went by, or the next ball - **now**.
>
> Imagine you are standing by the riverbed watching the water pass you; at a particular moment in time, that is the frame of time you should focus on, it is the moment that matters. Disregard the sticks and debris that float by, focus on that moment instead, deal with what needs to be dealt with, and then move on.

It is essential in squash that you don't waste your energy or focus on the last point that was played, or the one upcoming - rather it should be dedicated to the point being played. This lesson too can be impressed upon our daily lives, to move on from the past, treat every day a new day and you'll feel much better. And when there are challenges and obstacles, acknowledge and dealth with them, then move on.

### Never just be _in_ the Game, be _in_ and _out_ of the Game

> Never be in the game, you'll get lost, heated, tired, worried - instead, be outside of the game, above it! From there you'll see the birds-eye-view and you become the puppeteer of the show.
>
> The game is about moving in and out of it - like your focus on a squash ball; a constant flux of narrow and wide focus.

As you watch the ball in squash come off the racquet strings of your opponent, your focus is narrowed, your vision tunnelled on that single point. Nothing else matters. Then the ball flies off and your focus relaxes, your limbs move as your brain subconsciously maps the trajectory and your vision expands, noticing the opponent move also.

We too react like so in life, but most of us are stuck in the game, our focus is narrow, tunnel visioned; spiralling down the rat-race. We fail this basic discipline of taking a step back, re-evaluating, changing and adjusting. There's so many distractions in our daily lives now: social media, FOMO, all swirling in our vision. Understand and notice this in your life and others.

### It's Too Hard

> It's not too hard, what's so hard about it? _Excuses rattling off_...
>
> No, it's not too hard, instead say "I can do it".

Easier said than done. That is true in part but it can be overcome, it's all up to you. Naturally when I first started learning squash, I lacked confidence in my ability and skill of the game although there was more to it. My own self-confidence and self-esteem were similarly low and my coach identified my frequent use of indecisive words: _"maybe I can do it", "I'm not sure"_... And so my journey began of not saying "that shot is too hard Ollie", "I just can't do it", to a silent "I can do it", and then a couple of years later; "I can do it Ollie, I just need to practice and do it."

The power of words is tremendous, many notable psychology studies have shown how positive vocal reinforcement can have significant positive effects on your actions. Identify what stops you from achieving the results, often it will be **you**. Don't be afraid, don't let fear control you - prepare, do the work and embrace it.

### To Change, you must first change your Thinking

> To change something, first change your thinking.

All those times when my coach was fixing a certain technique of my stroke or when he was teaching me a new one; he would always reply to my struggles with: "change your thinking Geoff." In my attempts to adjust the swing arc or slant of my racquet, the ingrained muscle memory and autonomous nature of my mind resisted the efforts to change - and so it is very tempting to give up - it's easy to say at this point, "it's too hard." But it isn't, and the seeds of change starts by changing your thinking as the brain is what controls everything else, including your muscles.

And we notice our "it's too hard" mindset all too often, whether that is us or in our colleagues; we spew a list of excuses against change, and our focus is usually directed to the excuses and obstacles, not to our thinking. After all, who likes to blame themselves?

### Before you can control any situation, you must control yourself

> Before you can control any situation, you must first control yourself.

Control is paramount in squash; they who controls the tempo, their shots, their movements; controls the game. To win a game, you must master your shots and your own movements before you can master the game - how can you master the game if you can't master how and where you hit a squash ball?

This isn't to encourage being a control-freak or micro-manage, but to identify and understand what to control first before controlling more. It is also critical to know what is outside your sphere of control - do not be tempted to obtain what you cannot control as it comes with a heavy price.

### Just Do It.

> I know it's clich√© but Nike's motto "Just Do It" sums it all up.

Now to put lessons into practice and that makes all the difference between you and the rest of the masses.
